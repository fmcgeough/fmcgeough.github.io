An Elixir project to provide Elixir developers with easy access to the
[AWS Code Deploy API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/).
The library resides in the github repo [ex_aws_code_deploy](https://github.com/fmcgeough/ex_aws_code_deploy)
and plugs into the various AWS API's provided by the library [ex_aws](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_aws).

The [Go AWS library definition](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/master/models/apis/codedeploy/2014-10-06/api-2.json) is a useful first step in understanding the data requirements for this API.

The library is available on [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_aws_code_deploy).
