Code to accompany the blog post [Elixir/OTP Supervision](https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2024/supervision/).
It is stored in the github repo [elixir-supervision](https://github.com/fmcgeough/elixir-supervision).

The blog post explains things more fully but this repo is an educational example of various
ways that you can configure supervisors and workers in Elixir.
