I’ve been using Elixir for projects at various companies since 2016.</p> <p>I’ve worked in software engineering long enough to have experienced a variety of languages and tools. I’ve worked directly with hardware and embedded systems via “C” then “C++”. Built enterprise software with “Java” and “Python”. Used “Ruby” for various utility things (as well as helping friends that had Rails issues and working on Rails code at a couple of companies). Built robust web apps and API’s with both “Java” and “Elixir”.</p> <p>I’m always looking for new things to learn in programming - both in low-level details and in how to get teams of people to work cooperatively to produce great software.</p> <h3 id="more-information">More Information</h3> <p>More importantly, I’m a husband, father, grandfather and hopefully, friend. Besides programming I like playing guitar (electric, acoustic, resonator), cooking, and reading. I’m apt to write blog posts about any of those.</p> <h3 id="contact-me">Contact me</h3> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmcgeough" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Linkedin</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/fmcgeough" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Github</a></li> </ul> </body></html>
