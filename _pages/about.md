I am an Elixir software developer. I've been using Elixir for projects at
various companies since 2016.

I've worked in software engineering long enough to have experienced a variety of
languages and tools. I've worked directly with hardware and embedded systems via
"C" then "C++". Built enterprise software with "Java" and "Python". Used "Ruby"
for various utility things (as well as helping friends that had Rails issues and
working on Rails code at a couple of companies). Built robust web apps and API's
with both "Java" and "Elixir".

I'm always looking for new things to learn in programming - both in low-level
details and in how to get teams of people to work cooperatively to produce
great software.

### More Information

More importantly, I'm a husband, father, grandfather and hopefully, friend.
Besides programming I like playing guitar (electric, acoustic, resonator),
cooking, and reading. I'm apt to write blog posts about any of those.
