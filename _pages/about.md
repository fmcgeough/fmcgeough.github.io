I am an Elixir software developer. I've been using Elixir for projects at
various companies since 2016.

I've worked in software engineering long enough to have experienced a variety of
languages and tools. I've worked directly with hardware and embedded systems via
"C" then "C++". Built enterprise software with "Java" and "Python". Used "Ruby"
for various utility things (as well as helping friends that had Rails issues and
working on Rails code at a couple of companies). Built robust web apps and API's
with both "Java" and "Elixir".

I'm always looking for new things to learn in programming - both in low-level
details and in how to get teams of people to work cooperatively to produce
great software.

### Teaching

Helping people learn makes me happy.

I spend time trying to develop Elixir code that can help developers
learn the language and how best to apply it. There are those that
think the time is better spent developing libraries. I understand
the thought process but I think ultimately having someone understand,
rather than just use, Elixir code is very worthwhile.

- [brod_mimic](https://github.com/fmcgeough/brod_mimic) - the main means of interacting
  with Kafka for most Elixir developers is the brod library. This library is written in
  Erlang. It can be a daunting task for developers new to Elixir to also take on
  learning Erlang as well. This project was developed to do a "port" of brod to Elixir.
  This allows developers to see how things are expressed in Erlang vs Elixir.

- [Elixir Supervision](https://github.com/fmcgeough/elixir-supervision). One of the more
  interesting aspects of Elixir (Erlang) is the actor model implementation and the
  principle of "let it crash". There are simple but powerful constructs in the language
  that allow a developer to easily build a supervision tree so that processes are
  restarted if (when) they crash. But most Elixir developers struggle with understanding
  the mechanics. This repo is sample Elixir code meant to demonstrate some aspects of
  Elixir Supervision.

### Other

I like music. I learned how to play guitar (not so badly) and I play
electric, acoustic and resonator guitars.

I enjoy cooking. Although I'll dive into cookbooks I mostly just
improvise with what we have on-hand.

I enjoy reading. A lot. I've been averaging reading over 100 books a
year for quite a while. I like fiction and non-fiction. If I find an
author I like I will generally go through all the author's books.
