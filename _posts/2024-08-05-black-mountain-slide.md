The Black Mountain company (Black Mountain picks) makes some great tools
for guitarists. I first became aware of their company when I was having
thumb pain. I had evidently worked way too hard on a particular bluegrass
song. I had gripped the heck out of my pick and managed to make my thumb
feel pretty bad. I was looking for something that would allow me to continue
to play without putting pressure on my thumb. I found Black Mountain thumb
picks.

I ordered an assortment of different style thumb picks so I could test a
few out and find one that worked for me. These worked great! Even after
my poor thumb got a bit of a rest and felt fine I continued to use the
thumb picks (along with my regular picks). The thumb picks have a spring
inside them so they lock on very securely.

A while later I ordered the Black Mountain Slide Ring. This is a cool type
of slide that leaves you with all 4 fingers to use for chords (or whatever).
This slide also has a spring so you can avoid issues with slide slipping.
Its got a nice weight to it and I've used it often.

I recently saw that they came out with a full-sized slide. The Slide Ring
is made of tungsten steel. The full-sized slide is nickel-plated. It also
has a spring inside it so you can ensure that it will work well regardless
of your finger size. The company sells a small, medium and large. I went
with a medium and it works fine on my pinky finger (because of the spring).

I recorded a short video to demonstrate it.
