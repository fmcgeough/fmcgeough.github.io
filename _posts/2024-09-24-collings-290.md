Single cut Collings 290. In aged Pelham Blue w/Throbak 52-54 P90s. Mahogany neck and body. Bought from Music Emporium in Lexington, Massachusetts in 2021.
I believe that the Music Emporium is the largest reseller of Collings guitars.

This guitar was named for the scenic 290 highway that winds past the Collings shop though the Texas Hill Country, the 290 is a modern day tribute to the original working man's rock'n roll guitar.

Practice session. Random samples. I generally turn on the Voice Memo app on my laptop and let it run and then listen back later to see how messed up I sounded.
