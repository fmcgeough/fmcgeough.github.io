This is another recording I found from long ago. It's really tinny
and I probably had turned on recording on my Mac laptop while
fooling around.

[Vic Chestnutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Chesnutt) was an
influential musician from Athens, Georgia. He collaborated with a
large number of musicians and had an outsized influence compared to
the sales of his albums.

He was partially paralyzed at 18 after a night of drinking and
driving. On [Terry Gross' Fresh Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXFE-hdxM9A)
he said he was "a quadriplegic from [his] neck down", and although he had feeling
and some movement in his body, he could not walk "functionally"
and that, although he realized shortly afterward that he could
still play guitar, he could only play simple chords.

He passed away in 2009 on Christmas Day as a result of an overdose
of muscle relaxants. He had dealt with consistent pain and lacked
insurance to cover needed surgeries.

This recording is really bad. Very tinny. Since I just sort of
stumbled over it I don't know how it was recorded but my I think
it was probably captured on a Mac laptop and its not so great
microphone. It's Chesnutt's song Supernatural. This was released
in 1994 and covered by numerous artists. In any case I decided to
post whatever I managed to scrounge together so here it is.
