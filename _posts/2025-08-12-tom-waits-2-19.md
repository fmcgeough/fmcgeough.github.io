Wicked Grin is the twenty-eighth studio album from blues singer John P. Hammond. The album is a collection of songs written by Hammond's friend Tom Waits, who produced the project. It was released in March 2001. It's a wonderful album. Here's the track listing.

The first song on the album is "2:19". It's a droning song in A minor and I thought it'd be great for slide guitar practice on my Mule Mavis resonator. Below is a portion of a practice session.

The phrase "wicked grin" appears in the lyrics of "2:19" in reference to the train leaving town.

```
Now I've always been puzzled by the yin and the yang
Come out in the wash, but it always leaves a stain
Sturm and Drang, the luster and the sheen
My baby's leaving on the 2: 19
Toss the baby with the water, and the preacher stole the bride
Sent her out for a bottle, but when she came back inside
Didn't have my whiskey, she didn't have my gin
But a hat full of feathers and a wicked grin
Hey, hey, I don't know what to do
Hey, hey, I will remember you
Hey, hey, I don't know what to do
My baby's leaving on the 2: 19
```

For the audio sample I used the Mule Mavis single cone resonator, a ceramic Rock Slide and a Wooly Coats amp and recorded it with my iPhone.
