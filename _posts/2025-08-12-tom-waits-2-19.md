Wicked Grin is the twenty-eighth studio album from blues singer John P. Hammond. The album is a collection of songs written by Hammond's friend Tom Waits, who produced the project. It was released in March 2001. It's a wonderful album.

The first song on the album is "2:19". Its Hammond, Waits and Kathleen Brennan. It's a droning song in A minor and I thought it'd be great for slide guitar practice on my Mule Mavis resonator.

The phrase "wicked grin" appears in the lyrics of "2:19", specifically in the line: "She didn't bring my whiskey, she didn't bring my gin. She had a hat full of feathers and a wicked grin."

I used a ceramic Rock Slide and finger-picked through a Wooly Coats amp and recorded it with my iPhone.
