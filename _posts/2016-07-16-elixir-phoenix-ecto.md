Wow. This is the first time in a while that I've been excited about a new programming language. Where learning the language wasn't just a chore to stay employed. Going through the documentation, code examples and a couple of recent books. Such a fundamentally different way of looking at solving problems. Using the excellent documentation. Can't wait to build something for real!
