## Overview

Some helpful hints on using your local library. My local library is in Dekalb County, Georgia. Some of the rules on the apps referenced below are different in other areas.

## Get a Library Card

If you do not have a library card then take 10 minutes out of your day and go into library and get one. It's a straightforward process. They just want to know that you live in the area (county ordinarily) that the library serves.

Library cards have an ID. That's a string of 14-15 digits (ordinarily). And you'll have a passcode tied to that ID.

## Download Libby

The [Libby app](https://libbyapp.com/interview/welcome#doYouHaveACard) runs on iPhones, iPads, Android devices, etc. The app gets tied to your library card and then you can borrow eBooks, audio books and magazines. There is no limit on the number of items you can have checked out with the Libby app. The terms may be different depending on where you live. In our area you can check out a book for 3 weeks, put a book on hold, and renew a book (if no one else is waiting for it).

You can read on a Kindle or Kindle app or within the Libby app itself. If you use the Kindle approach then you'll use Amazon to return a book early. Otherwise it's all done in the Libby app.

Only a certain number of people can be reading or listening to a book at a time. So, just like with a physical book, you might have to wait a while to get the book you want.

## Download Kanopy

I installed [Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com/en) on our Samsung TV and on our Apple TV box. This allows you to watch movies and tv series available through the library. The catalog includes a lot of classic films, documentaries and award winning foreign films.

Kanopy works off a credit system (in our area anyway). You get a certain number of credits per month and you can "check out" a movie or series until you run out of credits. Then you have to wait until the next month.

Unlike Libby there is no limit on the number of people who can be watching a movie or tv series at the same time. The limit is on the total amount of content.

## Download Hoopla

The [Hoopla App](https://www.hoopladigital.com/) is an alternative or addition to Libby / Kanopy. With Hoopla you are given credits like Kanopy. Once you've associated your Hoopla account with your library card you can enjoy audiobooks, eBooks, comics, movies, TV, magazines, or music from your computer, your phone, your car, even your TV.

Unlike Libby there is no limit on the number of people who can be reading (or listening) to a book at the same time. The limit is on the total amount of content.

## Use On Hold

If you want to read a physical book then use your library's online system to put books on hold. In the library system I use you can put up to 15 books on hold. You can schedule when you'd like to be put on hold for a book. Your library sends an email notification when a book is available.
