I keep working on my slide. Love old blues tunes and after listening to them I'm always thinking I should play more.

This is using my Mavis Mule Resonator in Open D through a Wooly Coats amp. It's recorded on my phone so quality is what it is.

I encourage anyone who practices any instrument to do some sort of recording so you can hear yourself later.
