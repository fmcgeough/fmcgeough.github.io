I've found NotebookLM an effective study tool. I wanted an infographic to describe the BEAM memory management and it did a decent job of it.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" 
        path="https://github.com/fmcgeough/blog_posts/blob/main/img/2026-02-05-beam-memory-management.png?raw=true" 
        class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

<div class="caption">
