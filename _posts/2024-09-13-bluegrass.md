I didn't grow up listening to bluegrass music or going to bluegrass festivals. My bluegrass exposure
up until my early twenties can be summed up as:

- listening to Flatt & Scruggs "The Ballad of Jed Clampett" on the Beverly Hillbillies (Jerry Scoggins
  is singing on that)
- happening to step into the family room where Dad was watching Hee-Haw (before quickly leaving because
  it seemed more embarrassing than funny).

It wasn't that I didn't _like_ bluegrass. I just never heard it. Nobody I knew was interested in
it. I never saw bluegrass albums. I wouldn't have been able to pick a Martin D-28 from a Gibson
J-45 out of a lineup. I'm doubtful whether I could identify a mandolin.

I joined the Coast Guard after high school. After I left the Coast Guard I lived in New England.
Surprisingly, New England was actually a hotbed of bluegrass music. There was a famous recording
company called "Rounder Records" and this was founded in 1970 in Somerville, Massachusetts.

There were a number of women that I met who really liked bluegrass music. So I started listening
to some of the classics I'd never been exposed to. Like "Will the Circle Be Unbroken" by The Nitty
Gritty Dirt Band. It was on that album that I first heard Doc Watson.

Doc Watson was blind from a young age (I didn't know this at the time). He was an amazing flatpicker
from North Carolina. After hearing him on the album I saw that he was coming to Boston to play at
the Sanders Theater at Harvard University. This is a great venue (acoustically anyway) for music.
After he was introduced he was led to his chair center stage by a young lady (that's when I realized
that "Holy shit! He's blind!"). He played a great concert and after that I went out and bought any
of his albums I could find.

Doc Watson led me to all sorts of other players like Tony Rice, Old and In the Way (a band Jerry
Garcia played banjo in), and Norman Blake. I continue to enjoy bluegrass music to this day and
it's exciting to see a resurgence with the popularity of Billy Strings.

I moved to Atlanta in 1990. Met my (future) wife and we had two daughters. This was how I met
Jeff Mosier. One of his daughters and one of our daughters were friends so they'd have play dates
and get together at either our place or their place. I knew Jeff was a musician but to me he was just
a terrific and patient father and all-around good guy. I had no idea he had played with Phish,
the Allman Brothers, etc. Or that he had been part of the iconic Atlanta band "Aquarium Rescue Unit".

We saw he was playing at a venue in Roswell Georgia called Mimosa Hall. This isn't that far from
us so we got tickets. And in May 2024 we saw him and his brother play. Jeff played the banjo and
his brother played his grandmother's Martin D-35 from the 1990s. It was awesome to finally hear
him! He has a very interesting approach to the banjo. And even though we haven't seen him for years
he gave both my wife and I a big hug. So still an incredibly nice human being. I recorded a little
snippet of one song they played but mostly I just sat and listened with a small audience to him
play and tell stories.

I've gotten into trying to play guitar myself over the years but was always very busy with work and
family and never had much time for it. But I've got a bit more time now and so I'm trying to learn
something beyond some basic blues riffs and the pentatonic scale. I'll even occasionally try to play
bluegrass (Note: I'm not very good at it at the moment). I have a Mavis Mule resonator guitar and I
had tuned it down to Open-C. This is C-G-C-G-C-E (from lowest string to highest). I was fooling
around with it and recorded this snippet of a "version" (not a good one) of Norman Blake's classic
bluegrass tune "Randall Collins".

If you are interested you should definitely check out Norman Blake. His music is phenomenal. And
you should try and listen to all different styles of music. Each one has something special to
touch our hearts and teach us.
