On Jul 31, 2023 I received my Mavis Mule resonator guitar. These guitars
are built by [Mule Resophonic](https://www.muleresophonic.com/) out of
Saginaw Michigan. The company was started by Matt Eich. The guitars he
and his team creates are very cool and I was happy to be able to get one.

Since its a small company you (generally) order your guitar with a small
deposit. When you get to the top of the queue Matt reaches out to go over
the specs for what you want built. The build process begins and you'll
get photos as the build is done.

Finally, when the guitar is complete you get some final photos. You settle
up the bill and the guitar is shipped to you. Here's some photos of my
Mavis.

I've played around with the Mavis immediately (of course). I had to set
it aside a bit as I dealt with other things but I finally got back to it.
One of the things I wanted to learn more about is slide guitar. I've got
quite a long way to go to get to where I'd like to be with this. This
is a small recent sample. The guitar is tuned to Open-G. I'm using a
slide ring made by [Black Mountain](https://blackmountainpicks.com/). They
make very inventive products for guitar. A normal slide is used on one
finger and that finger becomes unavailable for playing chords, etc. With
a slide ring you can use all your standard chord shapes.
