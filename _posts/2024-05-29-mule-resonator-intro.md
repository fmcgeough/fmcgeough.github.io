On Jul 31, 2023 I received my Mavis Mule resonator guitar. These guitars
are built by Mule Resophonic out of Saginaw Michigan. The company was
started by Matt Eich. The guitars he and his team creates are very cool
and I was happy to be able to get one.

One of the things I wanted to learn more about is slide guitar. I've got
quite a long way to go to get to where I'd like to be with this. This
is a small recent sample. The guitar is tuned to Open-G. I'm using a
slide ring made by [Black Mountain](https://blackmountainpicks.com/). They
make very inventive products for guitar. A normal slide is used on one
finger and that finger becomes unavailable for playing chords, etc. With
a slide ring you can use all your standard chord shapes.
