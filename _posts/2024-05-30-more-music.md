This was a song I recorded a while ago. I really can't remember when I
did it but it was probably around the time the song was released by
the Avett Brothers (2008?).

It's the Avett Brother's song "The Greatest Sum". Visit their
[website](https://www.theavettbrothers.com/) for the latest releases
and tour information.

I enjoyed the lyrics.

```
This and who I used to be
Donâ€™t matter much at all to me
The pit you dug to plant your feet
A far cry from my destiny
Not even the clouds
Not even the past
Not even the hands of God
Could hold me back from you
```

It looks like the recording was done on my phone so the quality isn't so
hot.
