I keep working at slide guitar. A typical session with the slide is a few minutes of warming up. Just get my fingers working again until the slide feels right. I'll then work on specific techniques or transitions and attempt a couple of songs.

A lot of slide playing is as an accompanying instrument. When I get a chance I play with other people where they can carry the melody and I just get to add some accents. Playing lead with slide is challenging!

I record the session on my phone and then break it up into snippets (if I'm feeling like doing the work). These are a couple of audio files from today's practice.
