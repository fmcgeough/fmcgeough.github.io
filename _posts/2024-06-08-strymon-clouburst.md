I sometimes wish I was more fluent in guitar pedals. I'm just not. But I do
have a couple of cool pedals that I've had some good times with. One is the
[Strymon Cloudburst](https://www.strymon.net/product/cloudburst). Its a reverb
pedal with interesting atmospheric effects. People that work at Strymon made
a great video (probably multiple) demonstrating its use. Go watch them. It's
super cool.

This is me. Using the Shabat Lion GB into a Strymon Cloudburst pedal and into
the [3rd Power MK II Spanky amp](https://3rdpower.com/products/amps/wooly-coats-spanky-mkii/). This is an amazing amp. I liked it from the first
time I plugged in.

I was using the neck-pickup on the Shabat. I was recording with my iPhone.
It definitely is atmospheric and was fun to play.
