After moving to Atlanta in 1990 I bought a guitar from
[Maple Street Guitars](https://www.maplestreetguitars.com/). This
is a wonderful guitar shop near public transportation (Marta). They
carry both acoustic and electric guitars. The folks that work there
are friendly and extremely knowledgable. You'll see postings about
one or more of them appearing in music venues around town.

Maple Street carries Taylor guitars and I bought a Taylor 310. Taylor
doesn't make these anymore. It's a terrific guitar though. Its Sapele
back and sides and Sitka Spruce top. It wasn't very expensive at the
time and they are relatively inexpensive now if you want to pick up
one used.

Sapele is part of the Meliaceae family - just like Honduran Mahogany.
It has a similar type of sound and is less expensive (and probably
more sustainable). )

I have this guitar hanging downstairs by my couch so I can pick it up whenever
the mood strikes me. Here's a couple of small samples.

One is a recording using Open-G tuning and a ceramic
slide from [The Rockslide](https://therockslide.com/). I got a couple of different
slides from them while I was trying to figure out what worked best for me. They
are really well crafted. I use this particular slide on my ring finger. And this
is just random stuff I was fiddling around with.
