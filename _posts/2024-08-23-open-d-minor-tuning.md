Open D Minor Tuning is not a real popular open tuning. Most people are
familiar with Drop-D. Then if you use a slide you most likely know
about a tuning from one your favorite slide players (Open D, Open
G or Open E). Open D Minor has a haunting tone and is what was
used by Skip James to record classics as "Devil Got My Woman" and
"Hard Time Killing Floor". But it's also been used in more recent
music. For example, the following songs use Open D Minor:

- "Spoonman" by Soundgarden
- "Wake Up" by Rage Against The Machine
- "Whatsername" by Green Day

I tuned the Mavis Mule resonator to Open D Minor for a practice
session. Here are a couple of recordings from that. No editing. Just
what I grabbed to hear how I sounded. So, pretty much a mess. But
it is a fun tuning to try out.
