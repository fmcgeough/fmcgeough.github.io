After a long day programming do you look forward to more programming? OK then. You might want to check out [http://exercism.io/](http://exercism.io/) (You might want to also seek help. Go outside once in a while
for crying out loud). It has problems in a wide variety of languages. You sign up with your github account and pick a language to work on (Java, Javascript, Scala, Python, Ruby are among the choices). You code up a solution to the problem and submit it. You can discuss your solution and others approaches and iterate on your design to improve it.

Each problem is large enough to be interesting but not so large as to demand a good portion of your time. It seems like an hour or two at most.

I found this a good way to expand my knowledge of languages I wanted to learn.
