A few years ago I was in [Righteous Guitars](https://righteousguitars.com/) in Roswell Georgia. It's a store that has a bunch of different makers of wonderful guitars. As they note on their website: "We pride ourselves in having the finest instruments around and treat each one with the realization that it is someone's dream guitar. If you are looking for an instrument that will speak to your creativity and provide a lifetime of enjoyment, the wait is over".

I had heard of [Novo Guitars](https://www.novoguitars.com/). It's a small team of people building cool guitars in Nashville, Tennessee. They are the only guitars designed and built by Dennis Fano. It was a newer company at that point and Righteous Guitars was working with them, spec'ing out guitars and then selling them (and working with customers to get their orders into Novo).

I tried the Novo Serus S they had. This is a strat type instrument. It has locking tuners, great pickups (2 Throbak single coil pickups and a Throbak SE 101 humbucker) in an incredibly light (for an electric guitar) roasted pine body. I ended up buying it. Some pictures of it are below.

I found a short video of me fooling around with it so I figured I'd upload that as well.
