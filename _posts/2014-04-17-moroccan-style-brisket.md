Frankly I don't think they necessarily have brisket in Morocco. Never been. and Moroccan-style is probably a stretch too but I had to call it something. Ah well. It was quite yummy and I got asked for recipe. Ingredients hmmm...let's see.

* about 2 pound brisket
* one large red onion, sliced thin
* 3 carrots, cleaned & chopped
* 2 parsnips, cleaned & chopped
* 2 TBL tomato paste
* 1 TBL Tukas hot pepper paste
* 1 tsp sweet paprika
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1 can chickpeas (drained and rinsed)
* 2-3 cups beef broth
* couple handfuls of prunes cut in half
* olive oil
* salt & pepper
* slivered almonds

Now... what did I do?

I turned my oven on low (300 degrees).

I got a good sized Dutch oven (3 1/2 quart I think) and added a generous amount of olive oil over medium-high heat. I added the red onions and cooked them for about 6-7 minutes until they were quite soft. I added the spices and tomato paste and Tukas hot pepper paste and cooked it for about a minute. Then I threw in the brisket, followed by all the other ingredients (except for slivered almonds) and covered the dutch oven and put it in oven for about 3 hours.

The house smelled wonderful at the end. I heated a bit more olive oil in a non-stick pan and threw in the slivered almonds with some sea salt. Toasted them for a couple minutes.

Slice the brisket. Cover it with a bit of the veggies and delicious broth, sprinkle with slivered almonds. There ya go.
