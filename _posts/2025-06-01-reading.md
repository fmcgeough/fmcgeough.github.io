## Other Notes

- Read all the Walllender novels. They're great. So is the series done by the BBC (?) that followed the general outline of the novels. In addition, there is a "Young Wallender" series on Netflix.
- I'm Starting to Worry About This Black Box of Doom is the best fiction that I've read this year, followed by Greenteeth. The Sirens' Call: How Attention Became the World's Most Endangered Resource is the best non-fiction I've read this year.
- We donated to PBS because we have an idiot for a president who has denied funding for PBS via an executive order. PBS is appealing this in court. Also would donate without the idiot's actions. We've been watching the "Grantchester" series and I decided to read the first novel for the series.
- The Murderbot novels are great fun and there is a quite good Apple+ series based on the first novel out now.
