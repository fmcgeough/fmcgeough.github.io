## the Wallander novels

I like all the Wallander novels. They were written by Swedish novelist Henning Mankell. The books were turned into a British television series broadcast from 2008 to 2016. The series follows the general outline of the novels. Kenneth Branagh played Inspector Kurt Wallender. The series is also excellent. In addition, there is a "Young Wallender" series on Netflix. There are two seasons of that series which is not a prequel. Rather, they placed the character into modern times. Some fans of the original novels objected to this.

## Best Books This Year

"I'm Starting to Worry About This Black Box of Doom" is the best fiction that I've read this year, followed by "Greenteeth". "The Sirens' Call: How Attention Became the World's Most Endangered Resource" is the best non-fiction I've read this year.

## PBS and Grantchester

We donated to PBS. If you donate $60+ you get PBS Passport. This gives you access to quite a bit of previously aired PBS content. We've been watching the "Grantchester" series and I decided to read the first novel for the series.

I caught a few older "Austin City Limits" too.

## Murderbot

The Murderbot novels are great fun. There is a quite good Apple+ series based on the first novel available to stream.

## Lessons in Chemistry

This is another book that has an Apple+ series. The core of the story from the novel is there but they took the story in some different directions. Both the novel and the series are good.

## Six Days of the Condor

This is what the movie "Three Days of the Condor" was based on. Its a first novel that was way more successful than the author could have imagined. The directory Sydney Pollack tightened up the story to condense events into three days because he thought that would work better for the movie. The movie is available in various places including the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/turner_video_748).
