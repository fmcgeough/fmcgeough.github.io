I bought my first electric guitar used from [Righteous Guitars](https://righteousguitars.com/)
in Roswell, Georgia. Its a [Shabat Lion GB](https://shabatguitars.com/product/lion-gb/).
The body is sugar pine and the neck is maple rosewood.
It has the [Lollar Charlie Christian pickup](https://www.lollarguitars.com/lollar-charlie-christian-pickups) instead in the neck position and the [Lollar
B.S.Tele Bridge](https://www.lollarguitars.com/lollar-telecaster-pickups/bs-tele-bridge).
It's finish is nitrocellulose Candy Appple Red.
