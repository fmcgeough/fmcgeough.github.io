A typical session with the slide is a few minutes of warming up. Just get my fingers working again until the slide feels right. I’ll then work on specific techniques or transitions and attempt a couple of songs.</p> <p>A lot of slide playing is as an accompanying instrument. When I get a chance I play with other people where they can carry the melody and I just get to add some accents.</p> <p>I record the session on my phone and then break it up into snippets (if I’m feeling like doing the work).

They were written by Swedish novelist Henning Mankell. The books were turned into a British television series broadcast from 2008 to 2016. The series follows the general outline of the novels. Kenneth Branagh played Inspector Kurt Wallender. The series is also excellent. In addition, there is a “Young Wallender” series on Netflix. There are two seasons of that series which is not a prequel. Rather, they placed the character into modern times. Some fans of the original novels objected to this.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="https://github.com/fmcgeough/blog_posts/blob/main/img/TheDogsOfRiga.jpg?raw=true" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Swedish cover of The Dogs of Riga </div> <h2 id="best-books-this-year">Best Books This Year</h2> <p>“I’m Starting to Worry About This Black Box of Doom” is the best fiction that I’ve read this year, followed by “Greenteeth”. “The Sirens’ Call: How Attention Became the World’s Most Endangered Resource” is the best non-fiction I’ve read this year.</p> <h2 id="pbs-and-grantchester">PBS and Grantchester</h2> <p>We donated to PBS. If you donate $60+ you get PBS Passport. This gives you access to quite a bit of previously aired PBS content.

It’s humorous sci-fi. The stories are written by American author Martha Wells. She’s the winner of four Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards and three Locus Awards.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="https://github.com/fmcgeough/blog_posts/blob/main/img/All_Systems_Red_-_The_Murderbot_Diaries_1_(cover).jpg?raw=true" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>In the series a security robot (secbot) is the narrator. Secbots are owned by some mega-corporation. They provide security for space explorations but also spy on the explorers for the mega-corporation. A secbot has a “governor unit” that can punish the secbot if they do not obey a human’s order (“punish” can be total destruction in some cases). The narrating secbot manages to hack it’s governor unit which allows it to escape it’s protection enslavement. The secbot renames itself murderbot, although this is a private name that it rarely shares with others. Murderbot enjoys downloading and enjoying interplanetary soap operas. As it spends more time with a series of caring entities (both humans and artificial intelligences), it develops genuine friendships and emotional connections, which it finds inconvenient.</p> <p>There is a quite good Apple+ series based on the first novel available to stream. It premiered on May 16, 2025.</p> <h2 id="lessons-in-chemistry">Lessons in Chemistry</h2> <p>This is another book that has an Apple+ series. The core of the story from the novel is there but they took the story in some different directions. Both the novel and the series are good.</p> <h2 id="six-days-of-the-condor">Six Days of the Condor</h2> <p>This is what the movie “Three Days of the Condor” was based on. Its a first novel that was way more successful than the author could have imagined. The directory Sydney Pollack tightened up the story to condense events into three days because he thought that would work better for the movie. The movie is available in various places including the <a href="https://archive.org/details/turner_video_748">Internet Archive</a>.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="https://github.com/fmcgeough/blog_posts/blob/main/img/Six_Days_of_the_Condor.jpg?raw=true" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The plot (of the movie and book) is that there is a small organization in the CIA that reads books looking for plots and counterplots. All this information is fed into a computer and used to analyze against actual CIA discovered events. The main character, Ronald Malcolm, stumbles upon a plot involving a secret organization within the CIA. As it turns out, this is an actual organization. When his report is sent “up the chain” the plotters send hit men to eliminate the entire reading group (it’s a small group). Ronald Malcolm escapes the assassination while everyone else in the office is murdered. He stumbles through various attempts on his life, uncovers the secret CIA sub group and ultimately publicly reveals their existence.</p> <p>The name “Condor” is Ronald Malcolm’s codename.</p> <p>One of the interesting things about this is that high ranking members of the government in the Soviet Union watched the movie. They thought it was describing a real CIA book reading group so they formed their own (much larger) group to do the tasks described in the movie.</p> <p>In the movie Ronald Malcolm is renamed to Joe Turner.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reading"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[List of books I've read so far in 2025]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Simple Ecto query pipelines</title><link href="https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/simple-ecto-pipelines/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Simple Ecto query pipelines"/><published>2025-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/simple-ecto-pipelines</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/simple-ecto-pipelines/"><![CDATA[<p>The Ecto library is the means used by Elixir developers to interact with a relational database.

Although it is providing fairly robust capabilities (filters, sorting, pagination) it falls apart if we want to join to other tables (for example, lets assume there’s a phone_numbers table that has a foreign key to contacts to allow a contact to have any number of phone numbers). The reason this probably does not work is that we might want to filter on the phone number (for example, give me all the contacts in area code 678) but there’s no means of indicating what table a filter applies to. There’s a similar situation with sorting. I’ll create another post to indicate how that might be handled.</p> <p>There is some checking of the parameters provided but there is no notification (logging, telemetry) to indicate that the function received bad input. In most cases you would want to have that. I think it’s generally fine to have the code proceed if the input data can be cleaned up but I’d want to know that some part of the codebase is passing input data that will never work.</p> <h2 id="benefits-of-this-approach">Benefits of this Approach</h2> <p>Pipelining to build an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ecto.Query</code> is a powerful tool that lets you write modules that provide filtering, sorting and pagination in a way that is fairly powerful while being easy to read and maintain.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="elixir"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to use Ecto pipelines to allow flexibility in queries]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Atkin White Rice</title><link href="https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/atkin-white-rice/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Atkin White Rice"/><published>2025-05-26T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-26T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/atkin-white-rice</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/atkin-white-rice/"><![CDATA[<p>On Christmas Eve I had a proximal fracture of my right humerus. This means the break was in the upper part of the humerus. It was just below the head of the humerus that fits into the shoulder socket. This was both frustrating and painful.</p> <p>I broke it by slipping on some ice that was on the sidewalk just next door to our house. I had been out for about a 2 mile walk. It was a coldish day. The temperature was below freezing. However, the skies were clear. It hadn’t rained recently. As a result I wasn’t paying close enough attention to the sidewalk when I got back from my walk. There was a sprinkler system leak onto the sidewalk. It froze into a thin smooth ice surface. Then I went down like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football with Lucy as the holder.</p> <p>Falls are the most common reason for a proximal fracture. Since its a large bone there is significant pain. I lay for a few seconds figuring out how to get myself back up since my right arm was useless at this point. I managed to get back up and got back home. My wife took me over to the hospital for an x-ray to confirm that it was broken. Thankfully, the bone wasn’t displaced so no surgery was needed.</p> <p>However, these fractures take quite a long time to heal. I was in a sling for 4-5 weeks and then began physical therapy. Ultimately I actually had to use a bone stimulator (Exogen Ultrasound device) to encourage bone growth to get the break sealed up. This seemed to work fine and the last x-ray showed that the bone was healed. The bone healing is not the end of things though. It will take another few months to get the strength back in my upper arm and the level of flexibility that I had before the break.</p> <p>One of the hardest parts of this whole process is that I was unable to play guitar. A couple weeks after the sling came off I could manage to play an electric because it had a thinner body and I could get my arm around it without significant pain. However, even with the electric, I could only play for 5 or 10 minutes at a time.</p> <p>During all this downtime from guitar playing I was listening to a lot of new music and watching many guitar YouTube videos. It was on YouTube that I discovered Atkin Guitars. Atkin Guitars was founded in Canterbury, England, in 1995. They build a number of models that are homages to pre-war Gibson and Martin guitars. They also built a tribute guitar that was a copy of Tony Rice’s D-28 (serial # 58957).</p> <p>The reason Atkin Guitars built a tribute for this particular guitar is because it is famous in the world of acoustic guitars. Here’s some of the details of its story.</p> <p>The Tony Rice guitar was originally built in 1935. It has Brazilian rosewood back and sides and an Adirondack top. All of these guitars that are still around and in decent shape have an incredible sound and are worth quite a bit. In 1935 it would have sold for around $100. As far as I know between its build in 1935 and 1959 there’s no story of who owned the guitar and how badly it was treated.</p> <p>We do know that the guitar had seen some rough times. In 1959 fifteen year old bluegrass guitarist Clarence White bought the guitar for $25. It was really beat up and awaiting repairs. Some previous owner had whittled the soundhole to widen it (there some accounts that say Clarence White whittled this but according to Fretboard Journal it was “some anonymous whittler”). The original fingerboard was gone. It had been replaced with an ebony board that being held on with tape! He bought it and brought it home to his father. White’s father - who was a very good guitar repair person - declared it a lost cause. But White was determined. He took the guitar to luthier Milt Owen. Owen said he could make it playable for another $25. He found an old Gretsch blank with 22 frets that became the fingerboard. The guitar had been brought back to life.</p> <p>When Owen gave the guitar back to White he cautioned that he had set the guitar up with light gauge strings and that is what should be used on the guitar. He said putting heavy gauge strings on it would cause it to “belly up”. “Bellying” refers to bowing of the soundboard of an acoustic guitar. The constant tension applied by the strings causes the bridge to rotate forward towards the neck; resulting in the warping of the top (especially behind the bridge), a slight drop at the sound hole and a raised action.</p> <p>White seemingly immediately ignored this advice. So after just a year of use the action was incredibly high and it was almost unplayable. It was at this point that 9 year old music prodigy Tony Rice ran into the guitar at a music show in southern California. White let Rice play the guitar for as long as he wanted that day and Rice was impressed with the sound. He said “The only thing I knew was that it looked like hell but it sounded like a million bucks to a 9-year-old kid!” At some time later, as the guitar had become even more unplayable, White leaned the guitar against a tree and shot it with his pellet gun.</p> <p>Finally, in 1965, the guitar was sold (or given) to his friend Joe Miller in 1965. The story I heard is that he used the D-28 as collateral for a loan to a get a Telecaster. In any case, it’s new owner (Miller) left the guitar under his bed for 9 years.</p> <p>In 1975 a grown Tony Rice was playing with the New South. He and fiddler Bobby Sloan chatted about Clarence White (who had passed away in 1973). Sloan brought up White’s D-28 and said he had sold it to Joe Miller. Rice decided he’d really like to own that guitar. He only had Joe Miller’s name, knew that he lived in Southern California and knew that his family had a chain of liquor stores. Using that info he tracked down the right Joe Miller. He told him he’d like to buy the D-28. Miller was aware of Tony Rice’s talents and agreed to sell the guitar. The guitar was appraised and sold to Rice for $550. The guitar was eventually put back in working shape by Richard Hoover (who would co-found Santa Cruz Guitars later).</p> <p>While Tony Rice owned the guitar in 1993 he lived with his wife in Crystal River, Florida. A hurricane hit in the middle of the night and they were evacuated without a chance to grab anything (including the D-28). The home flooded. The guitar was under water for a couple hours before it was retrieved but it no longer sounded like it used to. Five years later a man named Harry Sparks slowly dried out the guitar. This caused a lot of the bracings to come loose. Eventually luthier and friend Snuffy Smith reglued all the bracings and got it back to its former glory.</p> <p>This guitar became legendary. It was used on any number of famous recordings. The enlarged soundhole gave it a unique volume and projection. There is a Tony Rice album called “58957: The Bluegrass Guitar Collection” where the guitar is used on 21 different bluegrass songs. He was joined on that album by Doc Watson, Sam Bush, Norman Blake, and many other masterful musicians.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Tony_Rice_RockyGrass.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Tony Rice and His Legendary D-28 </div> <p>There are a number of guitar makers who have crafted replicas of Rice’s iconic guitar. Santa Cruz has a Tony Rice model. So does Bourgeois, Martin, Huss &amp; Dalton, Collins and, the aforementioned, Atkin Guitars.</p> <p>After watching lots of Atkin Guitar videos and hearing a number of artists playing various models I decided I’d try and trade my Lowden F-34 guitar and get the Atkin Tony Rice model. The Lowden was amazing but I really wanted the Atkin model.</p> <p>Atkin Guitars decided to name their replica the “White Rice” model as an homage to both Clarence White and Tony Rice. They sell it with both a Madagascar rosewood back and sides and one with Indian rosewood. I found one at Music Emporium in Boston Massachusetts with the Madagascar rosewood, worked out a trade for my Lowden (and forked over some more $$$) and got the Atkin Guitar.</p> <p>It’s only been recently that I’ve been able to play the new guitar for more than a couple minutes. It’s amazing and easily the best acoustic I own. I’d like to get another Atkin Guitars model at some point. Maybe their homage to the Gibson J-45.</p> <p>The Atkin White Rice I purchased has:</p> <ul> <li>Madagascar Rosewood Back &amp; Sides</li> <li>Torrefied Adirondack Spruce Top</li> <li>Ebony Bridge and Fingerboard</li> <li>Nickel Gotoh Tuners</li> <li>Scalloped Forward Shifted Bracing</li> <li>Aged Nitrocellulose Lacquer</li> <li>Nut Width is 1 11/16”</li> <li>Neck carve is Medium C</li> <li>Scale length 25 1/2”</li> <li>String spacing 2 3/16”</li> </ul> <p>There are no inlays on the guitar.

When you build applications you are going to use libraries. Libraries can be either open source like Phoenix or privately created libraries. This post is some general notes on Elixir and dependency management. Please check the actual Elixir documentation (for your particular version) to get the most accurate answers to any questions.</p> <ul> <li>https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.1.1/Mix.Tasks.Deps.html</li> <li>https://hexdocs.pm/hex/Mix.Tasks.Hex.Outdated.html</li> <li>https://hexdocs.pm/hex/Mix.Tasks.Hex.Audit.html</li> <li>https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/dependencies-and-umbrella-projects.html</li> </ul> <h2 id="where-do-dependencies-come-from">Where Do Dependencies Come From?</h2> <p>A mix.exs file exists for a mix project. The file defines a module and the module has the statement: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use Mix.Project</code>. Example:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>defmodule Xyz.MixProject do
  use Mix.Project

  &lt;etc, etc&gt;
</code></pre></div></div> <p>See <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.18.3/Mix.Project.html">Mix.Project</a> for detailed information. An implementation of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project/0</code> function is required in the module. This function returns a keyword list representing configuration for the project. One of keyword items is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:deps</code>. This is a list of dependencies of this project. Defaults to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code>.</p> <p>Dependencies are specified in a particular way (described below). When dependencies are fetched mix creates a mix.lock file. This file has the final resolved dependency information and is what is used for building your software.</p> <h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2> <p>The mix.exs and mix.lock files exist in different places and with slightly different rules depending on the choice of project structure.</p> <p>It’s probably useful to go over project structure before talking about library dependencies since you may run into three project organizations in Elixir. The project organization has an impact on the mechanics of dependency management.</p> <h3 id="flat-project">Flat Project</h3> <p>The first type of project is flat/standard. This is the type of structure that you get if you invoke <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix phx.new</code>. For a Phoenix web app generated with:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mix phx.new --no-html --no-live --no-tailwind \
    --no-esbuild --no-mailer xyz
</code></pre></div></div> <p>you’d get a general directory structure like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/xyz
  mix.exs
  mix.lock
  /lib
    /xyz
    /xyz_web
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In a flat structure all the dependencies are put in the top-level mix.exs file. Performing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix deps.get</code> creates and populates the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.lock</code> file.</p> <h3 id="umbrella-project">Umbrella Project</h3> <p>The second type of project is an umbrella project. You can generate a Phoenix app as an umbrella project using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--umbrella</code> option. For a Phoenix web app generated with:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mix phx.new --no-html --no-live --no-tailwind \
  --no-esbuild --no-mailer --umbrella xyz
</code></pre></div></div> <p>you’d get a general directory structure like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/xyz
  mix.exs
  mix.lock
  /apps
    /xyz
      mix.exs
    /xyz_web
      mix.exs
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In an umbrella structure the top-level mix.exs file has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deps/0</code> function. However, the deps are available only for this project and cannot be accessed from applications inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/</code> folder. For example, you might add a dependency on credo so you can run credo over all the source code contained in the multiple subdirectories under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/</code></p> <p>The dependencies for the deliverable are contained in the mix.exs files for the two apps subdirectories xyz and xyz_web. Note that you can have as many “apps” as you want in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/</code> directory. Each directory would have its own mix.exs file. The two shown above are generated by default. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xyz</code> directory is meant to hold “business logic”. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xyz_web</code> directory is meant to hold “all the code dealing with web requests”.</p> <p>The umbrella project structure is recognized by mix. When you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix deps.get</code> from the command line a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix.lock</code> file is created in the top-level directory. This file will contain dependencies for all the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/</code> subdirectories in your project.</p> <h3 id="poncho-project">Poncho Project</h3> <p>The third project type is a poncho project. Poncho projects are common in embedded Elixir (Nerves) projects. You may also find this approach in Phoenix code. In a poncho app the top-level mix.exs uses a path to indicate where code is. That means that could separate code into different directories but you are not required to have it all under an “apps” directory.</p> <p>Unlike an umbrella project, a poncho project will usually have a mix.lock file in each of the subdirectories referenced in the top-level mix.exs file. The subdirectories are compiled more like library dependencies.</p> <p>To compile the project each of your local directories that are under your project directory. Then go to the top level project directory to build the release. You don’t have the ability to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix test</code> from the top level and have it run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix test</code> on all the code in all of your directories.</p> <h2 id="version-information">Version Information</h2> <p>Elixir projects are required to follow the version format outlined in the <a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer 2.0 schema</a>. A version is identified by three numbers: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.</p> <p>There is additional information in the Elixir documentation on how to handle pre-releases and build information:</p> <blockquote> <p>Pre-releases are supported by optionally appending a hyphen and a series of period-separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers consist of only ASCII alphanumeric characters and hyphens ([0-9A-Za-z-]).</p> </blockquote> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"1.0.0-alpha.3"
</code></pre></div></div> <blockquote> <p>Build information can be added by appending a plus sign and a series of dot-separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers consist of only ASCII alphanumeric characters and hyphens ([0-9A-Za-z-]):</p> </blockquote> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"1.0.0-alpha.3+20130417140000.amd64"
</code></pre></div></div> <p>SemVer naming actually has rules. These rules are not enforced by Elixir but it’s important to know what they are and to know whether dependencies you are using are observing the rules. The rules are important because developers, in general, expect them to be observed. Here are the rules:</p> <p>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:</p> <ul> <li>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes</li> <li>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner</li> <li>PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes</li> </ul> <p>Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.</p> <p>Assuming all your dependent libraries are following these rules you can make a choice on how much risk to introduce in managing your dependencies via a dependent’s requirements.</p> <h2 id="dependencies-and-requirements">Dependencies and Requirements</h2> <p>When you specify that your code depends on a library you setup a requirement for it. One part of the requirement is where the library can be found: hex.pm, github, etc. Another part is which version of the library you want. To specify the version you can use the common comparison operators such as &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, and ==. These work just like you’d imagine. Here’s some examples:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Requirement</th> <th style="text-align: center">Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">{:phoenix, “== 1.7.20”}</td> <td style="text-align: center">Only version 1.7.20 is allowed</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">{:phoenix, “&gt;= 1.7.20”}</td> <td style="text-align: center">Gets the latest version that is 1.7.20 or greater</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">{:phoenix, “&gt; 1.7.20”}</td> <td style="text-align: center">Gets the latest version that is greater than 1.7.20</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">{:phoenix, “&lt;= 1.7.20”}</td> <td style="text-align: center">Gets the latest version that is less than or equal to 1.7.20</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">{:phoenix, “&lt; 1.7.20”}</td> <td style="text-align: center">Gets the latest version that is less than 1.7.20</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Requirements also support <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">or</code> for complex conditions:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      # 2.0.0 and later until 2.1.0
      "&gt;= 2.0.0 and &lt; 2.1.0"
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This is such a common requirement that there is a “special” operator to express it: “~&gt;”.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    # 2.0.0 and later until 2.1.0
    "~&gt; 2.0.0"
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The “~&gt;” operator indicates that the highest least-significant digit version of the library can be used. So, in the example, “~&gt; 2.0.0” means that “2.0.0”, “2.0.1”, “2.0.2”, etc can be used but “2.1.0” cannot.</p> <p>This means if you only specify MAJOR and MINOR digits you are allowing any MINOR digit but the MAJOR must match. So “~&gt; 2.0” means that “2.0.0”, “2.1.7”, “2.5.4” are all acceptable.</p> <p>The most common case is to specify down to the PATCH. This allows bug fixes but blocks backward compatible changes.</p> <p>Your approach needs to examine whether the library you are dependent on is actually following the SemVer rules. Most (if not all) of them will.</p> <h3 id="options-for-requirements">Options for Requirements</h3> <p>There are a number of options available when specifying a requirement for a dependency. Here are some common options you’ll see (for a complete list of options consult the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.1.1/Mix.Tasks.Deps.html">Mix.Tasks.Dep documentation</a>).</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:optional</code> - this marks the dependency as optional. In such cases, the current project will always include the optional dependency but any other project that depends on the current project won’t be forced to use the optional dependency. However, if the other project includes the optional dependency on its own, the requirements and options specified here will also be applied. Optional dependencies will not be started by the application. You should consider compiling your projects with the mix compile –no-optional-deps –warnings-as-errors during test, to ensure your project compiles without warnings even if optional dependencies are missing</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:only</code> - the dependency is made available only in the given environments, useful when declaring dev- or test-only dependencies</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:override</code> - if set to true the dependency will override any other definitions of itself by other dependencies</li> </ul> <h3 id="overriding-a-library-dependency">Overriding a Library Dependency</h3> <p>You can run into issues where one library you are using requires one version of a library while a second library requires a different version. The requirements are in conflict and the app won’t compile unless you intervene.</p> <p>One way to intervene is to specify the version to use in your app’s dependencies using the option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">override: true</code>. Be aware that if you override across a MAJOR version you may cause serious issues with your app. It’s important to understand why a library has specified an older version of a library. In many cases its simply that the library specifying the older version is not being maintained or not maintained at a rate that aligns with the other library you are using. However, that is not necessarily the case.</p> <h2 id="mixlock">Mix.lock</h2> <p>The mix.lock file is generated when you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix deps.get</code>. This is the file that contains all of the dependencies for the project. It includes not only the dependencies declared in your mix.exs file but also all of the dependencies of your libraries. For example, for a Phoenix generated project the mix.lock file looks like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>%{

</code></pre></div></div> <p>The mix.lock entry starts with the library name (“phoenix”:). It then has a tuple indicating the library is pulled from hex.pm and it has the version of the library that was indicated in the mix.exs file (in this particular case).</p> <p>As shown in the section on “Dependencies and Requirements” the version that ends up in the mix.lock file can be different from the version specified in the mix.exs file. It will meet the requirements that you specify. If the requirements cannot be met then the build fails.</p> <p>The information in the mix.lock file is used during the build process. It isn’t used to indicate how the code is actually deployed. In the mix.exs file you can specify releases under the project. This is a list allowing multiple entries. Each entry specifies something that can be released independently. You can look at the doc for ‘mix release’ for more information.</p> <h2 id="ci-and-dependencies">CI and Dependencies</h2> <p>For applications I recommend that developers check in the mix.lock file for your application. Your CI builds should use:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mix deps.get --check-locked
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The documentation for <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.18.3/Mix.Tasks.Deps.Get.html#module-command-line-options">mix deps.get</a> command line options indicates that this will raise if performing the get of the dependency would result in a change to the mix.lock file.</p> <p>The reason to do this is to ensure that what you build and deploy matches what developers are using in their own environments to test their code. It catches changes that are unexpected. After figuring out the change and deciding its fine you can update your mix.lock file to resolve the issue. If the change might cause a problem then you’ll have to use a tighter restriction on the fetched dependencies so that your production code uses the version you want.</p> <h2 id="dependency-conflicts">Dependency Conflicts</h2> <p>If your app is dependent on libraries and libraries are dependent on other libraries then there can be conflicts. These occur when a requirement for a library in one mix.exs file conflicts with the requirement in another. For example, here are two statements that have a conflict that the compiler cannot resolve.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{:phoenix, "&lt; 1.7"}
{:phoenix, "&gt;= 1.7.6"}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The Phoenix library cannot be both below version 1.7 and greater than or less than 1.7.6. The compile will fail.</p> <p>It is up to the developer to resolve these type of conflicts. The app can only have one version of the Phoenix library loaded.</p> <p>It is possible to force an override in your application’s mix.exs if you have issues like this. For example:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{:phoenix, "&gt;= 1.7.6", override: true}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This generally requires an investigation to ensure you are not just going to break a library when you override to force a version the library has not declared as compatible.</p> <h2 id="checking-if-dependencies-are-up-to-date">Checking If Dependencies Are Up To Date</h2> <p>There is a built in command in mix to allow you to check if your dependency is up to date:</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix hex.outdated</code></p> <p>As long as the dependencies you use are in hex.pm this will output information that tells you that a library is “Up-to-date”, “Update possible” or “Update not possible”.</p> <p>If this outputs “Update not possible” then it means that you cannot get the most current library without modifying your requirement specification for the library. That is, you’ll have to edit your mix.exs file manually.</p> <p>It’s important to run this on a consistent basis to be aware of when your dependencies are falling behind the current releases. Keeping your dependencies up to date will save you lots of heartache.</p> <p>It’s important to review a CHANGELOG.md for a library (assuming it has one) before updating a dependency. Although its important to keep your dependencies updated, its much more important to ensure that your application actually functions. Be careful. Read through the changes done to a library and test thoroughly in a non-production environment before updating your dependency.</p> <h2 id="my-library-is-abandoned">My Library Is Abandoned</h2> <p>Open source software is wonderful. But if you are writing an app you might use a library that has only a single maintainer. This might work perfectly well when you first deploy your application. But it can be multiple years later and you are still using the version that you originally depended on because no releases have been done for the library.</p> <p>I’d suggest attempting to contact the library author. Add issues to their project to indicate why its important that the library is updated. Create pull requests to perform the needed updates.</p> <p>If the library author seems unreachable then you really have to fork the repo and begin developing and maintaining the software out of the new repo. I’d add to the README.md file to indicate what you are doing and why. I’d keep the library public so you might possibly also be able to leverage other folks in the Elixir open source community. At this point you are no longer using hex.pm and will have to reference the github location in your library requirement.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="elixir"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some notes about Elixir dependencies]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Writing Confusing Code in Elixir</title><link href="https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/making-confusing-code/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Writing Confusing Code in Elixir"/><published>2025-03-14T14:11:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-14T14:11:00+00:00</updated><id>https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/making-confusing-code</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/making-confusing-code/"><![CDATA[<p>I got into the Elixir language fairly early on. I was working at a company that used Java and Scala and was pretty bored. I was, in truth, also aggravated at the quality of the code that I’d see produced. The code would solve the problem, true. But it solved it in a way that made the code hard to look at. And hard to look at code is generally not going to be maintained well.</p> <p>Looking at Elixir code and beginning to write it was great. I thought, foolishly, that here was a language that would eliminate this type of code. It was so easy to write code that was great to read. The fact that it was built around immutability eliminated a whole swath of problems that I’d seen. It was so much easier to write code that solved problems with a collection of worker processes. And, importantly for me, it was easy to read.</p> <p>I developed a few Phoenix web apps for the company. These were definitely skunk works projects that I developed completely independently. I let engineering teams know that they were available and they got used a fair amount. They became one part of forming a SRE team at the company. After this I moved on to work at companies where Elixir was a first class citizen. That’s when I discovered that, as it turns out, just like with Java, you can make interesting messes with Elixir too. Here’s one example.</p> <p>I worked on a service that had a REST API that fetched data. The data could be paged. The caller passed a limit and offset as query parameters. There were a few simple rules:</p> <ul> <li>limit and offset both had to be integer values (well String representations of those values since they are coming in as query parameters)</li> <li>limit had to be greater than or equal to 1</li> <li>limit had to be less than or equal to 25</li> <li>offset had to be greater than or equal to 0 (no negative offsets)</li> </ul> <p>The code to handle this looked something like this (simplified):</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>def fetch_page(conn, params) do
  Parameters.parse(params, fn limit, offset -&gt;
    case do_some_fetch(limit, offset) do
      {:ok, data} -&gt; send_response(conn, data, limit, offset)
      :error -&gt; invalid_request(conn)
  end)
  rescue e -&gt;
     ## Some more code to handle exceptions that might get thrown
     ## by the Parameters module or data fetching
end
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That is, the folks that wrote the code created a module to parse out the limit and offset but the function that was written required that the caller pass in a function that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Parameters</code> module would call passing it the parsed limit and offset. The actual work is inside this function.</p> <p>The problem with this code was 1) the wrong module is in the driver’s seat. Parameters shouldn’t be what is driving how my code works. It makes error handling awkward and the code harder to read; 2) in order to test the Parameters module you have to pass a function to the parse/1 function. That’s going to cause initial confusion for developers added to the project. Callbacks like this are not a great idea; 3) once the parameters are parsed the code was then passing the data on to the fetcher as individual parameters. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with this. But it’s kind of a pain if we decide to add additional parameters later. I prefer to pass a map that has been typed and documented; 4) Instead of using a FallbackController to handle errors the controller was handling errors. It also was forced to account for exceptions that might be thrown by the Parameters parse or the data fetching. I don’t want this in my controller code. I want the lower level code to handle these problems so that my controller code is clean and straightforward. Instead of that we had code that was kind of dense and hard to parse at a glance.</p> <p>So I refactored this into something that looked more like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>def fetch_page(conn, params) do
    with {:ok, parsed_params} &lt;- Parameters.parse(params),
         {:ok, fetched_data} &lt;- DataFetcher.fetch(parsed_params) do
      send_response(conn, parsed_params, fetched_data)
    end
end
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Using the with statement means we only send a response if the caller of the REST API passed valid parameters and the code was able to get to the database and fetch data.</p> <p>In order to get to this state there had to be some thought given to the errors returned by the modules called by the controller. We had to normalize on an error format and agree on a set of standard errors. This was easy to do and made everyone happier.

These are the files and some general information about them.</p> <ul> <li>config.exs - used for storing global information needed in any environment</li> <li>dev.exs - used for storing global information needed only in a dev environment</li> <li>prod.exs - used for storing global information needed only in a prod environment</li> <li>runtime.exs - used to store global information for any environment.</li> <li>test.exs - used for storing global information needed only in a test environment</li> </ul> <h2 id="when-is-evaluation-done">When is Evaluation Done</h2> <p>The config.exs, dev.exs, prod.exs and test.exs files are evaluated at build time - before the application is compiled and before dependencies are loaded. Its important to understand this. If you attempt to do something like this in your prod.exs file:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>config :bureau, Bureau.SecretHolder,
    secret1: System.get_env("SECRET_CONFIG_THING1")
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Then secret1 will be set to whatever you have set in your compile environment (probably nothing).</p> <p>If you want to use the system environment to configure how your production app works then you use the runtime.exs file. This file is read after our application and dependencies are compiled and therefore it can configure how our application works at runtime. If the config above was in runtime.exs then secret1 is set to whatever the environment variable SECRET_CONFIG_THING1 stores on the machine on which you run your app.</p> <p>Be aware that runtime.exs is evaluated at runtime for all the Mix environments. When you are running unit tests locally your runtime.exs file is evaluated.</p> <p>Because this is the case you’ll find code like this in a lot of runtime.exs files:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import Config

if config_env() == :prod do
  database_url =
    System.get_env("DATABASE_URL") ||
      raise """
      environment variable DATABASE_URL is missing.
      For example: ecto://USER:PASS@HOST/DATABASE
      """
end
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We’re protecting setting up the database_url to when the config environment is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:prod</code>. This keeps us from overwriting the quite different database_url we most likely have for dev and test environments.</p> <h2 id="what-config-files-am-i-using">What Config Files am I using?</h2> <p>The config.exs file is evaluated (at compile time) for all environments. The dev, test, and prod config files are evaluated based on the environment being compiled. This is because of the line at the end of the config.exs file:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import_config "#{config_env()}.exs"
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config_env/0</code> function is in the Config module in Elixir. It returns the Mix environment. The Mix environment is obtained with:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>String.to_atom(System.get_env("MIX_ENV") || "dev")
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That is, Elixir looks for the value associated with “MIX_ENV” and if its not set then its going to default to “dev”.</p> <p>The runtime.exs file, as indicated earlier, is loaded for all environments. Generally, when you are developing locally you are using:</p> <ul> <li>config.exs</li> <li>dev.exs</li> <li>runtime.exs</li> </ul> <p>When you are running unit tests you are using:</p> <ul> <li>config.exs</li> <li>test.exs</li> <li>runtime.exs</li> </ul> <p>When you are running your code in production you are using:</p> <ul> <li>config.exs</li> <li>prod.exs</li> <li>runtime.exs</li> <li>(and maybe releases.exs)</li> </ul> <h2 id="what-about-releasesexs">What about releases.exs?</h2> <p>Before Elixir 1.11 an app that wanted to use environment variables in production would use a file called releases.exs. This file was also stored in the config directory. There was no runtime.exs.</p> <p>The releases.exs was similar to runtime.exs but not quite the same. The releases.exs was evaluated at runtime but only for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:prod</code>. The runtime.exs is used for all the mix environments.</p> <p>You can still have a releases.exs (as well as a runtime.exs) in an app. However, its confusing and you should migrate whatever is in your releases.exs file to the runtime.exs file and delete the releases.exs file.</p> <p>If you do have both files then the runtime.exs file is executed first followed by the releases.exs file. Its easy to see how confusing and error prone it is to have both. Your runtime.exs might try to setup an application environment value and releases.exs could overwrite its value.</p> <h2 id="can-a-dependency-function-be-called-from-a-config-file">Can a Dependency Function be called from a config file?</h2> <p>Not in any of the config files evaluated at build time. This is because those files are executed prior to loading dependencies. Your dependency code isn’t there.</p> <h2 id="can-a-dependency-function-be-called-from-runtimeexs">Can a Dependency Function be called from runtime.exs?</h2> <p>Yes. Keep in mind that the runtime.exs file is not available to whatever code you are calling. In general, it’s not a great idea and I’d avoid it.</p> <p>If you think you absolutely must then I’d keep José Valim’s PR notes when introducing runtime.exs in mind:</p> <blockquote> <p>Since “config/runtime.exs” is used by both Mix and releases, it cannot configure :kernel, :stdlib, :elixir, and :mix themselves. Attempting to configure those will emit an error. For those rare scenarios, you will need to use “config/releases.exs” - but “config/releases.exs” will remain simple, which will reduce the odds of syntax errors.</p> <p>Since “config/runtime.exs” is used by both Mix and releases, it cannot invoke “Mix” directly. Therefore, for conditional environment compilation, we will add a env/2 macro to Config that will be available for all config files.</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="elixir"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Review of How Config Files Are Used in a Phoenix Application]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Staying up to date in Elixir</title><link href="https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/mix-phx-new/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Staying up to date in Elixir"/><published>2025-03-02T16:04:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-02T16:04:00+00:00</updated><id>https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/mix-phx-new</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fmcgeough.github.io/blog/2025/mix-phx-new/"><![CDATA[<p>One thing I suggest to folks new to Elixir is to periodically get the latest version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phx.new</code> and use it to generate a project.

All the dependencies are “Up-to-date”.</p> <h2 id="examining-the-new-things">Examining the New Things</h2> <p>The “new” things I noted are:</p> <ul> <li>the generation automatically included two telemetry related libraries: telemetry_metrics and telemetry_poller.</li> <li>instead of using cowboy as the HTTP server Phoenix now uses Bandit.</li> <li>there’s a dependency on dns_cluster that is a fairly recent addition</li> </ul> <p>Let’s examine how those are being used and think about whether we need to modify any existing apps that we have to include the functionality that they bring.</p> <h2 id="telemetry_metrics-and-telemetry_poller">telemetry_metrics and telemetry_poller</h2> <p>These are libraries that you may already be using. Perhaps you are using something that wraps them instead.</p> <p>At the lowest level (that you’re apt to deal with as an Elixir developer) is the telemetry library. This library allows code that you write as part of an application and libraries that you use to generate events. It provides a common means of communicating measurement information.</p> <p>The telemetry_metrics library is written in Elixir. The telemetry_metrics library “provides a common interface for defining metrics based on :telemetry events. These metrics can then be published to different backends using our Reporters API”. This is the key thing for the library. It tries to normalize telemetry events by allowing the developer to describe what they are (counter? last_value?) and the expectations for a Reporter that will send those events on to an external system. Note that no external system is required. The library has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Telemetry.Metrics.ConsoleReporter</code> that is a useful way of debugging the information provided (measurements and metadata) when events are generated.</p> <p>The telemetry_poller library is written in Erlang. It allows an app to “periodically collect measurements and dispatch them as Telemetry events”. The library itself starts a telemetry_poller to periodically gather VM statistics (memory used, processes, run queues, etc) and send them to the telemetry system. The app can define its own telemetry_poller with its own events of interest. The library documentation describes how this is done.</p> <p>The reason to have a telemetry poller is that there is no “triggering event” to generate the metric, A poller is needed to gather the metrics.</p> <p>If you look at the generated code in the web directory you’ll see there is a file called “telemetry.ex”.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>defmodule BureauWeb.Telemetry do
