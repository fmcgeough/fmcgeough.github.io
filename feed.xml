Never been. and Moroccan-style is probably a stretch too but I had to call it something. Ah well. It was quite yummy and I got asked for recipe. Ingredients hmmm…let’s see.</p> <ul> <li>about 2 pound brisket</li> <li>one large red onion, sliced thin</li> <li>3 carrots, cleaned &amp; chopped</li> <li>2 parsnips, cleaned &amp; chopped</li> <li>2 TBL tomato paste</li> <li>1 TBL Tukas hot pepper paste</li> <li>1 tsp sweet paprika</li> <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li> <li>1/2 tsp ground ginger</li> <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li> <li>1 can chickpeas (drained and rinsed)</li> <li>2-3 cups beef broth</li> <li>couple handfuls of prunes cut in half</li> <li>olive oil</li> <li>salt &amp; pepper</li> <li>slivered almonds</li> </ul> <p>Now… what did I do?</p> <p>I turned my oven on low (300 degrees).</p> <p>I got a good sized Dutch oven (3 1/2 quart I think) and added a generous amount of olive oil over medium-high heat. I added the red onions and cooked them for about 6-7 minutes until they were quite soft. I added the spices and tomato paste and Tukas hot pepper paste and cooked it for about a minute. Then I threw in the brisket, followed by all the other ingredients (except for slivered almonds) and covered the dutch oven and put it in oven for about 3 hours.</p> <p>The house smelled wonderful at the end. I heated a bit more olive oil in a non-stick pan and threw in the slivered almonds with some sea salt. Toasted them for a couple minutes.</p> <p>Slice the brisket. Cover it with a bit of the veggies and delicious broth, sprinkle with slivered almonds. There ya go.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="food"/><category term="food"/><category term="recipes"/><category term="cooking"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[march & april, looking forward to summer]]></summary></entry></feed>
